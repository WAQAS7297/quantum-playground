# ⚛️ Quantum Playground

> _A hands-on space where qubits dance, entanglement happens, and classical thinking stops._

Welcome to **Quantum Playground** — a beginner-friendly and open-source hub for exploring **Quantum Computing** using **Qiskit** and **PennyLane**.  
This repo is designed to help students, enthusiasts, and developers get practical with quantum circuits, gates, and algorithms — all while keeping things simple and fun. 🚀

## 🧠 What’s Inside

| Folder | Description |
|:-------|:-------------|
| `examples/` | Ready-to-run example circuits (Qiskit & PennyLane) |
| `src/` | Custom utilities and circuit-building tools |
| `tests/` | Unit tests to validate circuits and components |
| `docs/` | Optional documentation for deeper learning (coming soon!) |

---

## 💻 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/quantum-playground.git
cd quantum-playground
````

### 2️⃣ Set up your environment

Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate     # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3️⃣ Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4️⃣ Run your first quantum program

```bash
python examples/qiskit/bell_state.py
```

You’ll see output similar to:

```
{'00': 510, '11': 514}
```

That means your **Bell state** worked — your qubits are officially entangled! ⚛️✨
